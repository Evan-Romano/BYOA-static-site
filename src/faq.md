# Frequently Asked Questions

## About the Site

### How was this site built?
This site is built using simple, efficient technologies: Markdown for content, basic HTML and CSS for structure and styling, and a minimal Node.js script to generate the static pages. No complex frameworks or databases required!

### Can I view the source code?
Yes! The source code for this site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/site). Feel free to use it as inspiration for your own projects.

### Why don't you use a framework like Next.js or Gatsby?
While these are excellent tools, I believe in using the simplest solution that gets the job done. For a personal site with blog functionality, static HTML and CSS are more than sufficient.
